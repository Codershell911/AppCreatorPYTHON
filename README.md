# AppCreatorPYTHON

This is my own app creator written in Python. You need to input the app name, press 'enter,' and it will create the folders and files. HOWEVER, YOU have to CODE IT. If you only enter a space in the input, it won't do anything. It will ask you whether it should run the build.gradle. If you input 'Y,' it will run; if 'N,' it will leave the code and print 'Exiting...'
